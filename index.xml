      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you think through this process you&amp;rsquo;ll start to find a few funny properties. For example what if we made a good action in frame 50 (bouncing the ball back correctly), but then missed the ball in frame 150? If every single action is now labeled as bad (because we lost), wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that discourage the correct bounce on frame 50? You&amp;rsquo;re right - it would. However, when you consider the process over thousands/millions of games, then doing the first bounce correctly makes you slightly more likely to win down the road, so on average you&amp;rsquo;ll see more positive than negative updates for the correct bounce and your policy will end up doing the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: December 9, 2016 - alternative view&lt;/strong&gt;. In my explanation above I use the terms such as &amp;ldquo;fill in the gradient and backprop&amp;rdquo;, which I realize is a special kind of thinking if you&amp;rsquo;re used to writing your own backprop code, or using Torch where the gradients are explicit and open for tinkering. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re used to Theano or TensorFlow you might be a little perplexed because the code is oranized around specifying a loss function and the backprop is fully automatic and hard to tinker with. In this case, the following alternative view might be more intuitive. In vanilla supervised learning the objective is to maximize \( \sum_i \log p(y_i \mid x_i) \) where \(x_i, y_i \) are training examples (such as images and their labels). Policy gradients is exactly the same as supervised learning with two minor differences: 1) We don&amp;rsquo;t have the correct labels \(y_i\) so as a &amp;ldquo;fake label&amp;rdquo; we substitute the action we happened to sample from the policy when it saw \(x_i\), and 2) We modulate the loss for each example multiplicatively based on the eventual outcome, since we want to increase the log probability for actions that worked and decrease it for those that didn&amp;rsquo;t. So in summary our loss now looks like \( \sum_i A_i \log p(y_i \mid x_i) \), where \(y_i\) is the action we happened to sample and \(A_i\) is a number that we call an &lt;strong&gt;advantage&lt;/strong&gt;. In the case of Pong, for example, \(A_i\) could be 1.0 if we eventually won in the episode that contained \(x_i\) and -1.0 if we lost. This will ensure that we maximize the log probability of actions that led to good outcome and minimize the log probability of those that didn&amp;rsquo;t. So reinforcement learning is exactly like supervised learning, but on a continuously changing dataset (the episodes), scaled by the advantage, and we only want to do one (or very few) updates based on each sampled dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More general advantage functions&lt;/strong&gt;. I also promised a bit more discussion of the returns. So far we have judged the &lt;em&gt;goodness&lt;/em&gt; of every individual action based on whether or not we win the game. In a more general RL setting we would receive some reward \(r_t\) at every time step. One common choice is to use a discounted reward, so the &amp;ldquo;eventual reward&amp;rdquo; in the diagram above would become \( R_t = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{t+k} \), where \(\gamma\) is a number between 0 and 1 called a discount factor (e.g. 0.99). The expression states that the strength with which we encourage a sampled action is the weighted sum of all rewards afterwards, but later rewards are exponentially less important. In practice it can can also be important to normalize these. For example, suppose we compute \(R_t\) for all of the 20,000 actions in the batch of 100 Pong game rollouts above. One good idea is to &amp;ldquo;standardize&amp;rdquo; these returns (e.g. subtract mean, divide by standard deviation) before we plug them into backprop. This way we&amp;rsquo;re always encouraging and discouraging roughly half of the performed actions. Mathematically you can also interpret these tricks as a way of controlling the variance of the policy gradient estimator. A more in-depth exploration can be found &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deriving Policy Gradients&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d like to also give a sketch of where Policy Gradients come from mathematically. Policy Gradients are a special case of a more general &lt;em&gt;score function gradient estimator&lt;/em&gt;. The general case is that when we have an expression of the form \(E_{x \sim p(x \mid \theta)} [f(x)] \) - i.e. the expectation of some scalar valued score function \(f(x)\) under some probability distribution \(p(x;\theta)\) parameterized by some \(\theta\). Hint hint, \(f(x)\) will become our reward function (or advantage function more generally) and \(p(x)\) will be our policy network, which is really a model for \(p(a \mid I)\), giving a distribution over actions for any image \(I\). Then we are interested in finding how we should shift the distribution (through its parameters \(\theta\)) to increase the scores of its samples, as judged by \(f\) (i.e. how do we change the network&amp;rsquo;s parameters so that action samples get higher rewards). We have that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla_{\theta} E_x[f(x)] &amp;= \nabla_{\theta} \sum_x p(x) f(x) &amp; \text{definition of expectation} \\
&amp; = \sum_x \nabla_{\theta} p(x) f(x) &amp; \text{swap sum and gradient} \\
&amp; = \sum_x p(x) \frac{\nabla_{\theta} p(x)}{p(x)} f(x) &amp; \text{both multiply and divide by } p(x) \\
&amp; = \sum_x p(x) \nabla_{\theta} \log p(x) f(x) &amp; \text{use the fact that } \nabla_{\theta} \log(z) = \frac{1}{z} \nabla_{\theta} z \\
&amp; = E_x[f(x) \nabla_{\theta} \log p(x) ] &amp; \text{definition of expectation}
\end{align}
$$
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this in English, we have some distribution \(p(x;\theta)\) (I used shorthand \(p(x)\) to reduce clutter) that we can sample from (e.g. this could be a gaussian). For each sample we can also evaluate the score function \(f\) which takes the sample and gives us some scalar-valued score. This equation is telling us how we should shift the distribution (through its parameters \(\theta\)) if we wanted its samples to achieve higher scores, as judged by \(f\). In particular, it says that look: draw some samples \(x\), evaluate their scores \(f(x)\), and for each \(x\) also evaluate the second term \( \nabla_{\theta} \log p(x;\theta) \). What is this second term? It&amp;rsquo;s a vector - the gradient that&amp;rsquo;s giving us the direction in the parameter space that would lead to increase of the probability assigned to an \(x\). In other words if we were to nudge \(\theta\) in the direction of \( \nabla_{\theta} \log p(x;\theta) \) we would see the new probability assigned to some \(x\) slightly increase. If you look back at the formula, it&amp;rsquo;s telling us that we should take this direction and multiply onto it the scalar-valued score \(f(x)\). This will make it so that samples that have a higher score will &amp;ldquo;tug&amp;rdquo; on the probability density stronger than the samples that have lower score, so if we were to do an update based on several samples from \(p\) the probability density would shift around in the direction of higher scores, making highly-scoring samples more likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Phillips Feynman (/ˈfaɪnmən/; May 11, 1918 – February 15, 1988) was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model. For his contributions to the development of quantum electrodynamics, Feynman, jointly with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga, received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.
Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World he was ranked as one of the ten greatest physicists of all time.[1]
He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the Rogers Commission, the panel that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. In addition to his work in theoretical physics, Feynman has been credited with pioneering the field of quantum computing, and introducing the concept of nanotechnology. He held the Richard C. Tolman professorship in theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology.
Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There&amp;rsquo;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics. Feynman also became known through his semi-autobiographical books Surely You&amp;rsquo;re Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think? and books written about him, such as Tuva or Bust! and Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman by James Gleick.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Customizing the homepage with widgets</title>
      <link>http://rahulpathakgit.github.io/post/widgets/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Homepage widgets display as sections on the homepage. They can be enabled/disabled and configured as desired. Academic has the following widgets available to use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About/biography&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected publications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent publications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent news/blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selected talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent talks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom widget (demonstrated with the &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The example site that you copied to create your site uses all the different types of widget (except talks), so you can generally just delete the widgets you don&amp;rsquo;t need and customize the parameters of the widgets you wish to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The parameters for each widget vary. They can be found in the preamble/frontmatter (between the pair of &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;) for each widget installed in the &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;By default, publications will be displayed in a simple list. If you prefer a more detailed list with abstract and image, you can enable the detailed publication list on the homepage by setting &lt;code&gt;detailed_list = true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;content/home/publications.md&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-a-widget-to-the-homepage&#34;&gt;Add a widget to the homepage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add a widget manually, copy the relevant widget from &lt;code&gt;themes/academic/exampleSite/content/home/&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widget identifiers are set to their respective filenames, so a &lt;code&gt;content/home/about.md&lt;/code&gt; widget can be linked from the navigation bar by setting the relevant URL as &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;#about&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that if you want to use multiple instances of a widget, each widget will be assigned a unique ID based on the filename that you set. You can then use that ID for linking, like in the above example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-the-custom-widget&#34;&gt;Using the custom widget&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use the custom widget to create your own home page sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply duplicate (copy/paste) and rename the example &lt;em&gt;teaching&lt;/em&gt; file at &lt;code&gt;content/home/teaching.md&lt;/code&gt;. Then edit the section title, weight (refer to &lt;em&gt;Ordering sections&lt;/em&gt; below), and content as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also wish to add a navigation link to the top of the page that points to the new section. This can be achieved by adding something similar to the following lines to your &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, where the URL will consist of the first title word in lowercase:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]
    name = &amp;quot;Research&amp;quot;
    url = &amp;quot;#research&amp;quot;
    weight = 10
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remove-a-widget-from-the-homepage&#34;&gt;Remove a widget from the homepage&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not require a particular widget, you can simply delete any associated files from the &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To remove a navigation link from the top of the page, remove the associated &lt;code&gt;[[menu.main]]&lt;/code&gt; entry in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordering-widgets&#34;&gt;Ordering widgets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The order that the homepage widgets are displayed in is defined by the &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; parameter in each of the files in the &lt;code&gt;content/home/&lt;/code&gt; directory. The widgets are displayed in ascending order of their &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt;, so you can simply edit the &lt;code&gt;weight&lt;/code&gt; parameters as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Managing content</title>
      <link>http://rahulpathakgit.github.io/post/managing-content/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rahulpathakgit.github.io/post/managing-content/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a brief guide to managing content with the Academic framework. Content can include publications, projects, talks, and news/blog articles. After you have read this guide about creating and managing content, you may also be interested to learn about &lt;a href=&#34;http://rahulpathakgit.github.io/post/writing-markdown-latex/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;writing content with Markdown, LaTeX, and Shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enable LaTeX math rendering for a page, you should include &lt;code&gt;math = true&lt;/code&gt; in the page&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble, as demonstrated in the included example site. Otherwise, to enable math on the homepage or for all pages, you must globally set &lt;code&gt;math = true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable source code highlighting by default for all pages, set &lt;code&gt;highlight = false&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. You can then enable source code highlighting only on pages that need it by setting &lt;code&gt;highlight = true&lt;/code&gt; in that page&amp;rsquo;s preamble. See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rahulpathakgit.github.io/post/writing-markdown-latex/#code-highlighting&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;code-highlighting docs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To display a featured image in content page headers, the parameters below can be inserted towards the end of a page&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble. It is assumed that the image is located in your &lt;code&gt;static/img/&lt;/code&gt; folder, so the full path in the example below will be &lt;code&gt;static/img/headers/getting-started.png&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be used to write an image caption or credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34;&gt;[header]
image = &amp;quot;headers/getting-started.png&amp;quot;
caption = &amp;quot;Image credit: [**Academic**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/)&amp;quot;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you wish to prevent a featured image automatically being used for a post&amp;rsquo;s thumbnail on the homepage, the &lt;code&gt;preview = false&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be added to &lt;code&gt;[header]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-publication&#34;&gt;Create a publication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a new publication:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new publication/my-paper-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the default variables at the top of &lt;code&gt;content/publication/my-paper-name.md&lt;/code&gt; to include the details of your publication. The &lt;code&gt;url_&lt;/code&gt; variables are used to generate links associated with your publication, such as for viewing PDFs of papers. Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;+++
abstract = &amp;quot;An abstract...&amp;quot;
authors = [&amp;quot;First author&#39;s name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Second author&#39;s name&amp;quot;]
date = &amp;quot;2013-07-01&amp;quot;
image = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
image_preview = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
math = false
publication = &amp;quot;The publishing part of the citation goes here. You may use *Markdown* for italics etc.&amp;quot;
title = &amp;quot;A publication title, such as title of a paper&amp;quot;
url_code = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_dataset = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_pdf = &amp;quot;pdf/my-paper-name.pdf&amp;quot;
url_project = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_slides = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
url_video = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
+++

Further details on your publication can be written here using *Markdown* for formatting. This text will be displayed on the Publication Detail page.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;url_&lt;/code&gt; links can either point to local or web content. Associated local publication content, such as PDFs, may be copied to a &lt;code&gt;static/pdf/&lt;/code&gt; folder and referenced like &lt;code&gt;url_pdf = &amp;quot;pdf/my-paper-name.pdf&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also associate custom link buttons with the publication by adding the following block(s) within the variable preamble above, which is denoted by &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[[url_custom]]
    name = &amp;quot;Custom Link&amp;quot;
    url = &amp;quot;http://www.example.org&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you enabled &lt;code&gt;detailed_list&lt;/code&gt; for publications in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, then there are a few more optional variables that you can include in the publication page preamble. You may use &lt;code&gt;abstract_short = &amp;quot;friendly summary of abstract&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;publication_short = &amp;quot;abbreviated publication details&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; to display a friendly summary of the abstract and abbreviate the publication details, respectively. Furthermore, there is the option to display a different image on the homepage to the publication detail page by setting &lt;code&gt;image_preview = &amp;quot;my-image.jpg&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. This can be useful if you wish to scale down the image for the homepage or simply if you just wish to show a different image for the preview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Any double quotes (&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;) or backslashes (e.g. LaTeX &lt;code&gt;\times&lt;/code&gt;) occurring within the value of any frontmatter parameter (such as the &lt;em&gt;abstract&lt;/em&gt;) should be escaped with a backslash (&lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;). For example, the symbol &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and LaTeX text &lt;code&gt;\times&lt;/code&gt; become &lt;code&gt;\&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\\times&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. Refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/toml-lang/toml#user-content-string&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;TOML documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-an-article&#34;&gt;Post an article&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a blog/news article:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new post/my-article-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the newly created file &lt;code&gt;content/post/my-article-name.md&lt;/code&gt; with your full title and content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hugo will automatically generate summaries of posts that appear on the homepage. If you are dissatisfied with an automated summary, you can either limit the summary length by appropriately placing &lt;code&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#33;&amp;#45;&amp;#45;more&amp;#45;&amp;#45;&amp;#62;&lt;/code&gt; in the article body, or completely override the automated summary by adding a &lt;code&gt;summary&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble such that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary = &amp;quot;Summary of my post.&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To disable commenting for a specific post, you can add &lt;code&gt;disable_comments = true&lt;/code&gt; to the post &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble. Or to disable commenting for all posts, you can either set &lt;code&gt;disqusShortname = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;disable_comments = true&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-project&#34;&gt;Create a project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new project/my-project-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the newly created file &lt;code&gt;content/project/my-project-name.md&lt;/code&gt;. Either you can link the project to an external project website by setting the &lt;code&gt;external_link = &amp;quot;http://external-project.com&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; variable at the top of the file, or you can add content (below the final &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt;) in order to render a project page on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;create-a-talk&#34;&gt;Create a talk&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create a talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new talk/my-talk-name.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then edit the newly created file &lt;code&gt;content/talk/my-talk-name.md&lt;/code&gt; with your full talk title and details. Note that many of the talk parameters are similar to the publication parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;manage-node-index-pages&#34;&gt;Manage node index pages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The node index pages (e.g. &lt;code&gt;/post/&lt;/code&gt;) are the special pages which list all of your content. They can exist for blog posts, publications, and talks. The homepage widgets will automatically link to the node index pages when you have more items of content than can be displayed in the widget. Therefore, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have much content, you may not see the automatic links yet - but you can also manually link to them using a normal Markdown formatted link in your content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can edit the title and add your own content, such as an introduction, by creating and editing the following content files for the node indexes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo new post/_index.md
hugo new publication/_index.md
hugo new talk/_index.md
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then remove all parameters except for &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;. Edit the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; parameter as desired and add any content after the &lt;code&gt;+++&lt;/code&gt; preamble/frontmatter ends. For example, you should have something similar to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-toml&#34;&gt;+++
title = &amp;quot;List of my posts&amp;quot;
date = &amp;quot;2017-01-01T00:00:00Z&amp;quot;
math = false
highlight = false
+++

Below is an automatically generated list of all my blog posts!

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;removing-content&#34;&gt;Removing content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, to remove content, simply delete the relevant file from your &lt;code&gt;content/post&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;content/publication&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;content/project&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;content/talk&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;view-your-updated-site&#34;&gt;View your updated site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have made changes to your site, you can view it by running the &lt;code&gt;hugo server --watch&lt;/code&gt; command and then opening &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;localhost:1313&lt;/a&gt; in your web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploy-your-site&#34;&gt;Deploy your site&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can build the static website to a &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; folder ready for deployment using the &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may then deploy your site by copying the &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory (by FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Rsync, git push, etc.) to your production web server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that running &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; does not remove any previously generated files before building. Therefore, it&amp;rsquo;s best practice to delete your &lt;code&gt;public/&lt;/code&gt; directory prior to running &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; to ensure no old or interim files are deployed to your server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing content with Markdown, LaTeX, and Shortcodes</title>
      <link>http://rahulpathakgit.github.io/post/writing-markdown-latex/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 20 Apr 2016 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://rahulpathakgit.github.io/post/writing-markdown-latex/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Content can be written using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LaTeX math&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo Shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, HTML may be used for advanced formatting. This article gives an overview of the most common formatting options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;sub-headings&#34;&gt;Sub-headings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emphasis&#34;&gt;Emphasis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Italics with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Bold with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough with ~~two tildes~~.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ordered-lists&#34;&gt;Ordered lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. First item
2. Another item
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;unordered-lists&#34;&gt;Unordered lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* First item
* Another item
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;images&#34;&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Images may be added to a page by placing them in your &lt;code&gt;static/img/&lt;/code&gt; folder and referencing them using one of the following two notations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A general image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;![alternative text for search engines](/img/screenshot.png)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A numbered figure with caption:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; figure src=&amp;quot;/img/screenshot.png&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Figure Caption&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[I&#39;m a link](https://www.google.com)
[A post]({{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;post/hi.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
[A publication]({{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;publication/hi.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
[A project]({{&amp;lt; ref &amp;quot;project/hi.md&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
[Another section]({{&amp;lt; relref &amp;quot;hi.md#who&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;emojis&#34;&gt;Emojis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.webpagefx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Emoji cheat sheet&lt;/a&gt; for available emoticons. The following serves as an example, but you should remove the spaces between each emoji name and pair of semicolons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I : heart : Academic : smile :
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ❤️ Academic 😄&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;blockquote&#34;&gt;Blockquote&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; This is a blockquote.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I have more [^1] to say.

[^1]: Footnote example.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have more &lt;sup class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a rel=&#34;footnote&#34; href=&#34;#fn:1&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;code-highlighting&#34;&gt;Code highlighting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pass the &lt;em&gt;language&lt;/em&gt; of the code, such as &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, as a parameter after three backticks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
# Example of code highlighting
input_string_var = input(&amp;quot;Enter some data: &amp;quot;)
print(&amp;quot;You entered: {}&amp;quot;.format(input_string_var))
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;# Example of code highlighting
input_string_var = input(&amp;quot;Enter some data: &amp;quot;)
print(&amp;quot;You entered: {}&amp;quot;.format(input_string_var))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;highlighting-options&#34;&gt;Highlighting options&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Academic theme uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://highlightjs.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highlight.js&lt;/a&gt; for source code highlighting, and highlighting is enabled by default for all pages. However, several configuration options are supported that allow finer-grained control over highlight.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following table lists the supported options for configuring highlight.js, along with their expected type and a short description. A &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;strong&gt;config.toml&lt;/strong&gt; column means the value can be set globally in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, and a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; in the &lt;strong&gt;preamble&lt;/strong&gt; column means that the value can be set locally in a particular page&amp;rsquo;s preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;option&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;type&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;config.toml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;preamble&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;boolean&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;enable/disable highlighting&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;slice&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;choose additional languages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;choose a highlighting style&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;highlight_version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;string&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;choose the highlight.js version&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;option-highlight&#34;&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt; option allows enabling or disabling the inclusion of highlight.js, either globally or for a particular page. If the option is unset, it has the same effect as if you had specified &lt;code&gt;highlight = true&lt;/code&gt;. That is, the highlight.js javascript and css files will be included in every page. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to only include highlight.js files on pages that actually require source code highlighting, you can set &lt;code&gt;highlight = false&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;, and then override it by setting &lt;code&gt;highlight = true&lt;/code&gt; in the preamble of any pages that require source code highlighting. Conversely, you could enable highlighting globally, and disable it locally for pages that do not require it. Here is a table that shows whether highlighting will be enabled for a page, based on the values of &lt;code&gt;highlight&lt;/code&gt; set in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; and/or the page&amp;rsquo;s preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;config.toml&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;page preamble&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;highlighting enabled for page?&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;unset or false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;no&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;false&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;true&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;option-highlight-languages&#34;&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; option allows you to specify additional languages that are supported by highlight.js, but are not considered &amp;ldquo;common&amp;rdquo; and therefore are not supported by default. For example, if you want source code highlighting for Go and clojure in all pages, set &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages = [&amp;quot;go&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;clojure&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. If, on the other hand, you want to enable a language only for a specific page, you can set &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; in that page&amp;rsquo;s preamble.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; options specified in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; and in a page&amp;rsquo;s preamble are additive. That is, if &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt; contains, &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages = [&amp;quot;go&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt; and the page&amp;rsquo;s preamble contains &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages = [&amp;quot;ocaml&amp;quot;]&lt;/code&gt;, then javascript files for &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; go and ocaml will be included for that page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; option is set, then the corresponding javascript files will be served from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;. To see a list of available languages, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs page&lt;/a&gt; and search for links with the word &amp;ldquo;languages&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_languages&lt;/code&gt; option provides an easy and convenient way to include support for additional languages to be severed from a CDN. If serving unmodified files from cdnjs doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet your needs, you can include javascript files for additional language support via one of the methods described in the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;option-highlight-style&#34;&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option allows you to select an alternate css style for highlighted code. For example, if you wanted to use the solarized-dark style, you could set &lt;code&gt;highlight_style = &amp;quot;solarized-dark&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option is unset, the default is to use the file &lt;code&gt;/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt;, either the one provided by the Academic theme, or else the one in your local &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; directory.  The &lt;code&gt;/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt; file provided by Academic is equivalent to the &lt;code&gt;github&lt;/code&gt; style from highlight.js.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; set, then &lt;code&gt;/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt; is ignored, and the corresponding css file will be served from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;. To see a list of available styles, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs page&lt;/a&gt; and search for links with the word &amp;ldquo;styles&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highlight.js demo page&lt;/a&gt; for examples of available styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all styles listed on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;highlight.js demo page&lt;/a&gt; are available from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to use a style that is not served by cdnjs, just leave &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; unset, and place the corresponding css file in &lt;code&gt;/static/css/highlight.min.css&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to change the default style that ships with Academic but you do want the style file served from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cdnjs server&lt;/a&gt;, set &lt;code&gt;highlight_style = &amp;quot;github&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; option is only recognized when set in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. Setting &lt;code&gt;highlight_style&lt;/code&gt; in your page&amp;rsquo;s preamble has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;option-highlight-version&#34;&gt;Option &lt;code&gt;highlight_version&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;highlight_version&lt;/code&gt; option, as the name implies, allows you to select the version of highlight.js you want to use. The default value is &amp;ldquo;9.9.0&amp;rdquo;. The &lt;code&gt;highlight_version&lt;/code&gt; option is only recognized when set in &lt;code&gt;config.toml&lt;/code&gt;. Setting &lt;code&gt;highlight_version&lt;/code&gt; in your page&amp;rsquo;s preamble has no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;Twitter tweet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To include a single tweet, pass the tweet’s ID from the tweet&amp;rsquo;s URL as parameter to the shortcode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; tweet 666616452582129664 &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;youtube&#34;&gt;Youtube&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;vimeo&#34;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; vimeo 146022717 &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;github-gist&#34;&gt;GitHub gist&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; gist USERNAME GIST-ID  &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;speaker-deck&#34;&gt;Speaker Deck&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; speakerdeck 4e8126e72d853c0060001f97 &amp;gt;}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rm-latex-math&#34;&gt;$\rm \LaTeX$ math&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-TeX&#34;&gt;$$\left [ – \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V \right ] \Psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi$$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$\left [ – \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V \right ] \Psi = i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, inline math can be written by wrapping the formula with only a single &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is inline: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon$
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is inline: $\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol\beta + \boldsymbol\varepsilon$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;table&#34;&gt;Table&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Markdown&#34;&gt;| Command           | Description                    |
| ------------------| ------------------------------ |
| `hugo`            | Build your website.            |
| `hugo serve -w`   | View your website.             |
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Command&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;

&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Build your website.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;hugo serve -w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;View your website.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;alerts&#34;&gt;Alerts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alerts are a useful feature that add side content such as tips, notes, or warnings to your articles. They are especially handy when writing educational tutorial-style articles. Use the corresponding shortcodes to enable alerts inside your content:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{% alert note %}}
Here&#39;s a tip or note...
{{% /alert %}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will display the following &lt;em&gt;note&lt;/em&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a tip or note&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{% alert warning %}}
Here&#39;s some important information...
{{% /alert %}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will display the following &lt;em&gt;warning&lt;/em&gt; block:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-warning&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s some important information&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34;&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;Footnote example.
 &lt;a class=&#34;footnote-return&#34; href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Migrate from Jekyll to Hugo</title>

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few tips for migrating an existing website from Jekyll to Hugo. These tips can be applied in conjunction with following Hugo Academic&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;move-static-content-to-static&#34;&gt;Move static content to &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with &lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt; will be copied as-is to the &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; output. Hugo keeps all static content under &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;. You should therefore move it all there.
With Jekyll, something that looked like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/
    ▾ images/
        logo.png
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;should become&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/
    ▾ static/
        ▾ images/
            logo.png
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as &lt;code&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt;) to be moved to &lt;code&gt;static&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;fix-content&#34;&gt;Fix content&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the amount of customization that was done for each post in Jekyll, this step will require more or less effort. There are no hard and fast rules here except that &lt;code&gt;hugo server --watch&lt;/code&gt; and the Hugo Academic example site are your friends. Test your changes and fix errors as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;publish&#34;&gt;Publish&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default is for Jekyll to publish the website to a &lt;code&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; directory, whereas Hugo publishes to a &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-practical-example&#34;&gt;A practical example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexandre Normand migrated his website from Jekyll to Hugo in less than a day. You can see all his changes by looking at this GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alexandre-normand/alexandre-normand/compare/869d69435bd2665c3fbf5b5c78d4c22759d7613a...b7f6605b1265e83b4b81495423294208cc74d610&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;diff&lt;/a&gt;. However, bear in mind that this example is &lt;strong&gt;not specific to the Academic theme nor does it use the latest version of Hugo&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
